# Description:

Using Scott Barrett's Udemy course, [Data Structures & Algorithms - Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/) I'm learning about Data Structures and Algorithms using Python and Big O: Time and Space Complexity of DSA. 

Throughout the course, I will make files for each subject with examples and notes that help document what I'm learning and how I best interpret the content. 

I may also end up adding other notes from other resources that help me along the way. The goal of this repo is to continue my learning post bootcamp and help keep myself accountable as I prepare to interview in the near future.

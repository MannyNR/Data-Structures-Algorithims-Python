# Description:

The goal of this repo is to continue my learning post bootcamp and help keep myself accountable, as I prepare to interview in the near future.

Using Scott Barrett's Udemy course, [Data Structures & Algorithms - Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-python/) I'm learning about Data Structures and Algorithms using Python and Big O: Time and Space Complexity of DSA.

Throughout the course, I will make files for each subject with examples and notes that help document what I'm learning and how I best interpret the content.

I will also add other notes/resources that help me along the way and provide reference below.
